This is designed to be a generic source-control solution.  It handles multiple different
repository types at once.

Currently, there are integrations for Visual Source Safe and StarTeam (only tested under win32).

It is designed to be easily extensible, with different source-control modules being loaded on demand.

There is some documentation, including how to create source-control modules.
